## The Problem
Applying for jobs means lots of repetitive copying/pasting of job descriptions into documents.


Sites like LinkedIn make it worse with their split-pane UI and dynamic containers: the JD lives in HTML elements that can shift or load late, so grabbing a clean copy isn’t always easy.


Tools like Teal or RocketReach solve parts of this for you, but they’re paid, closed-source, and you can’t tweak them for your own workflow.


## The Breakthrough
Learned that a browser bookmark isn’t just a link — it can be a “bookmarklet”: a tiny snippet of JavaScript that runs on whatever page you’re on.


First version: grabbed the whole page text → messy (menus, notifications, CSS junk).


### Iterations:


Added selectors like .jobs-description__container → cleaner JD.


Added fallback loops → script tries multiple selectors until it finds the right one.


Added polling (waits a few seconds) → fixes LinkedIn’s slow-loading content.


Discovered the “highlighted text” method: instead of fighting LinkedIn’s containers, just grab whatever you’ve selected on the page and save it directly as .txt. Simple, portable, works on any site.


## Why It Matters
Real-world speed: job postings can be competitive, sometimes only the first 5–10 applicants get reviewed. Shaving even minutes off your workflow adds up over dozens of applications.


Control: you don’t need to depend on SaaS tools with paywalls; you’re building your own pipeline.


Transferable skills: this is web scraping 101 — the same skills apply to security testing, research, data collection, even automating parts of your future IT/cyber work.


### Broader Context
Other job sites (Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Minnesota Works) use different, often more static HTML layouts → easier to scrape consistently.


Paid tools like RocketReach or email scrapers work the same way under the hood: they grab structured HTML, parse it, and present it as “magic.”


What we did manually with bookmarklets is a microcosm of what commercial platforms scale up with big infrastructure.


## Lessons Learned
Dynamic UIs = moving targets: container names change, content loads late. Debug with browser dev tools (Inspect → Console) to see what selectors actually work today.


Small wins compound: a few lines of JavaScript can save hours over a week.


Speed + customization = edge: tailoring automation to your own workflow beats waiting for generic SaaS features.


Keep it modular: capture (bookmarklet) → classify (Python/PowerShell) → organize (folders, resumes, cover letters). Each piece can be improved independently.



✨ Big picture:
 This isn’t just about job hunting. It’s your first hands-on example of how code, even in tiny snippets, directly changes your day-to-day life. That’s the same energy that powers developer tools, security research, and IT automation — the thrill of bending messy systems into something that serves you.
