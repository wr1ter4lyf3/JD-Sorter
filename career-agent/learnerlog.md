Today I updated code to help convert JDs from MinnesotaWorks, which provides JDs in PDF and word format. I asked for clarification on "helper functions." 

🧩 What “Helper Functions” Are

In my script, helper functions are small, single-purpose functions that make your main logic simpler and easier to read.

Instead of cramming everything into one long function (which becomes a nightmare to maintain), I delegate tasks to smaller, focused helpers.

Think of them like:

“Tiny workers that handle one job extremely well.”

Here are the existing helper functions in my code: 

| Function | Purpose | Key Role |
|--|--|--|
sanitize(text: str) |Removes invalid filename characters | Keeps folder and file names OS-safe |
get_role_bucket(text: str) | Classifies job descriptions into “Cyber”, “Helpdesk”, “Network”, etc. | Automates sorting logic
ensure_dirs(bucket, title, company) | Creates the appropriate folder structure for each job | Keeps job folders consistent
update_tracker(bucket, title, company, job_folder) | Logs each new job entry into your tracker spreadsheet | Keeps your tracker up to date
extract_job_info(jd_text, fallback_filename)	| Extracts role and company names from job descriptions or filenames | Ensures accurate folder naming


With the help of CodeGPT (I can't take all the credit, ha), I was able to build a modular automation framework for my code so that every helper does one clean job.
CodeGPT also adds very helpful comments to specify what's what--which makes updating the code much easier. Soon I'll go from plugging in revised code to just debugging it myself :)

🆕 What I Added: pdf_to_txt()

I introduced a new helper:

pdf_to_txt(pdf_path: Path) -> Path

Purpose: Convert any incoming .pdf job description into .txt automatically.

It’ll:

1. Take the PDF path.

2. Extract text (using pdfminer.six).

3. Save it as a .txt file (same name, same folder).

4. Return the path to that new text file.

It'll look like this (had to look up using triple backticks and the language name to get this to look right lol): 

from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

```Python def pdf_to_txt(pdf_path: Path) -> Path:
    """Converts a PDF job description to a text file for further processing."""
    txt_path = pdf_path.with_suffix(".txt")
    try:
        print(f"📄 Converting PDF to text: {pdf_path.name}")
        text = extract_text(pdf_path)
        txt_path.write_text(text, encoding="utf-8")
        print(f"✅ PDF converted successfully → {txt_path.name}")
        return txt_path
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️ Error converting {pdf_path.name}: {e}")
        return None
```


I dropped it into the `on_created()` section of the code. 

I also clarified some confusion I had around Python vs Powershell: 

🧠 What PowerShell Actually Is

PowerShell is a command-line shell and a scripting language built by Microsoft.
Think of it as a supercharged terminal that lets you:

Run commands (like cd, dir, etc.)

Run scripts (like .ps1 files)

And even call other languages or programs, like:

Python 🐍

Node.js 🟩

Java ☕

C# executables ⚙️

I decided to run PowerShell and Python together since I'm tired of turning the job sorter on manually! 

📄 Run PowerShell and Python Together

You could even create a PowerShell script (.ps1) that does this:

```# job_sorter.ps1
Write-Host "🚀 Starting Job Sorter..."
python "C:\Users\Student\Documents\Career\scripts\career_agent_hybrid_v2.py"
Write-Host "✅ Job Sorter complete!"
```


When I run that .ps1, PowerShell:

Prints my message

Launches Python

Runsmyr script

Returns control to PowerShell when it’s done

It’s like a chain of command! 🧩

Yay~ 

Python does the logic, and PowerShell orchestrates the workflow. 

To confirm if the watcher is running, I can launch Task Manager and view "Details." Once I find a python.exe process running, I know my sorter is ready to sort. 

And because I want to implement the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability), I plan to add some additional functions: 

🧠 “Availability”

My PowerShell launcher + Task Scheduler setup means:

✅ The watcher runs every time I log in

✅ No manual steps required

✅ It restarts automatically after reboot

✅ I can check its health via a log (coming soon)

This is a local code so it doesn't require the internet to run. Very useful for "housekeeping" days when I need to update my JD graveyard or recalibrate my job searching strategy, etc. 

🧾 “Integrity”

Integrity = trusting that data hasn’t been changed accidentally or maliciously.

I can extend my setup to protect integrity by:

|Feature |	What It Does |
|--|--|
|✅ Hashing your tracker|	Compute a SHA256 hash each time your .ods or .csv updates, and compare to last known hash — prevents unnoticed tampering.|
|🧩 Write-protecting old rows |	Optional lock so previous entries in your tracker can’t be modified except through automation. |
|🧱 Backup rotation|	Auto-copy your tracker file daily or weekly to a /Backups folder. If anything corrupts, restore instantly.|

Python already has the built-ins for this:

```Python import hashlib

def hash_file(path):
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        return hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()
```


I could even append that hash to my job_sorter.log after each update, so every run has a verifiable integrity stamp.

🔐 “Confidentiality”

This is about keeping my data safe — especially since my tracker contains company names, job titles, and timestamps.

Here’s how I could layer in protection gradually:

|Level|	Action|	Description|
|--|--|--|
|🪶 Basic|Save tracker + logs in my user directory (already private by default) |	Only accessible by my account|
|🧱 Intermediate|	Zip and password-protect weekly backups|	Use shutil.make_archive() or 7-Zip via PowerShell|
|🔒 Advanced|	Encrypt .ods and .log files using Python’s cryptography library|	I define a key; script decrypts only when running|

You could even encrypt your log entries at write time and decrypt them when you review — same pattern used in local system logs for secure auditing.

CodeGPT suggested a ton of more stuff but I also still have to actually apply for a jobs (lol) so that's end of log for today. 

UPDATE: Had to do some patching cuz I don't know how to indent. Still didn't see Python.exe in task manager so I had to bring up the code instead of letting PowerShell run it (it's going to do this automatically upon start-up but for now I'm still manually testing it so it may seem like an extra step for now). We were missing another requirement (Py2DF). 

After I got that patched up, we were up and running and I even got to convert my first PDF! Woot Woot!
