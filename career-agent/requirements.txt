✅ GOAL:

Automatically color-code the job tracker spreadsheet (tracker.ods, not .cvs or .xls because macros will not convert) without ever opening LibreOffice manually.

So the workflow becomes:

📄 Drop a .txt job description

🐍 Python sorts and updates the tracker

🤖 LibreOffice converts tracker.csv → tracker.ods

🎨 Macro auto-runs in the .ods to color rows

✅ Tracker is always up-to-date and formatted
