✅ GOAL:

Automatically color-code the job tracker spreadsheet (tracker.ods, not .cvs or .xls because macros will not convert) without ever opening LibreOffice manually.

So the workflow becomes:

📄 Drop a .txt job description

🐍 Python sorts and updates the tracker

🤖 LibreOffice converts tracker.csv → tracker.ods

🎨 Macro auto-runs in the .ods to color rows

✅ Tracker is always up-to-date and formatted

Why won't macros and manual edits saves as .cvs? 

🧠 When You Use CSV → ODS Conversion:
libreoffice --headless --convert-to ods tracker.csv --outdir ...

⚠️ It does create a new file every time:

LibreOffice converts the .csv into a brand new .ods file

It overwrites the existing .ods if one already exists with the same name

But it does not preserve:

Macros

Custom formatting

Event bindings (like auto-run macros)

Which is why I said earlier:

"If you're using macros or formatting, you can't rely on converting .csv every time — it wipes that stuff."

✅ Now that you’re using .ods directly (with ezodf):

You are no longer converting anything.

You're modifying the .ods file in place

Your macros stay saved in that file

Your color coding remains

Nothing gets overwritten

This is exactly what you want for a fully automated system with formatting + macros.
