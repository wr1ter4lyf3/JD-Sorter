# JD-Sorter
Scripts designed to automate the repetitive parts of searching and applying for jobs. 

Started with "JD Scraper," a bookmarklet meant to scan a job posting on a web page and export the JD as a .docx or .txt file. The second part includes "JD-Sorter," which utilizes PowerShell scripts to generate a directory based on the JD. The directory consists of subfolders "Cover letter submitted," "Resume submitted," and "Job description," located beneath the parent folder titled after the JD's listed position title and company. 
The last phase of the project would involve updating a job tracker spreadsheet located on the user's local machine; however, I would like to explore cloud options. This phase would also include the ability to have modular control over one's resume and to automate recommended iterations to submit for a particular job.
